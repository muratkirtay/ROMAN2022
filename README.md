> **Abstract:** Multimodal integration and theory of mind are critical cognitive concepts for achieving trustworthy human-human and human-robot interaction. Although the research includes multimodal integration and theory of mind has been well-established areas in human-robot interaction (HRI), the HRI studies that aim to combine these concepts on robots to form trust in humans remain limited.  In this study, we extend our robot trust model into a multimodal setting in which the Nao humanoid robot leverages audio-visual data to perform a sequential multimodal pattern recalling task while interacting with a human partner who has different guiding strategies: reliable, less-reliable, and random. Here the humanoid robot is equipped with a multimodal auto-associative memory module to process audio-visual patterns to extract cognitive load (i.e., cost) and an internal reward module to perform cost-guided reinforcement learning.  After interactive experiments,  the robot associates the low cognitive load (i.e., high cumulative reward) yielded during the interaction with the trustworthiness of the guiding strategy of the human partner. At the end of the experiment, we provide a free choice to the robot to select a trustworthy instructor. We show that the robot forms trust in a reliable partner. In the second setting of the same experiment,  we endow the robot with an additional simple theory of mind module to perform the same task. In this case, we demonstrate that the robot's performance has improved compared to the previous experiment.
